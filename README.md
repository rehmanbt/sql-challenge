Database created multiple times and inserted the Schemata and tables created successfully everytime as per enclosed query. 
While importing data in tables, if the sequence/order of import is not in line then can end up getting error while loading the data in the saved tables. 
Once data is saved in all tables with primary and foreign keys assigned, ran the data analysis file successfully for all queries providing successfull results as expected.
